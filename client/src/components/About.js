        <strong>nephews</strong> is a service that allows people that struggle
        with tech get the support they need from volunteers (nephews) with
        better tech skills.
      </p>
      <p>For example </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Why did the TV channels disappear?</li>
        <li>What should I do if the Internet is not working?</li>
        <li>How can I send a photo with my phone?</li>
        <li>Should I trust this strange email I just received?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Volunteers with some time to spare can sign and they will be notified
        when someone needs support. If they are available, they just have to
        accept the notification and the call will be forwarded to them.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is no need to install anything, and you don't have to be an expert
        engineer. Knowing how everyday devices work is already of great use.
        It's a bit like the TV and phone support you provide your parents or
        aunties with, but for people with no... nephews.
